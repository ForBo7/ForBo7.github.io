## Option 1: Predefined services

### Live example

Check out [Isaac Flath's blog]() to see the MailChimp widget in action!

## Option 2: The Manual, Simple Way

Perhaps you don't have an alternative address. Or perhaps you just want something simple to get started with. There's still a way to implement blog
subscriptions! It's more manual, and gets the job done: embedding online forms (e.g., Google Forms, Microsoft Forms, etc.).

It involves embedding a form in your website, collecting responses in a spreadsheet, creating a mailing list from that spreadsheet, and composing and
sending an email to the created list.

The example in the steps below use Google Forms, though it would be very similar to Microsoft Forms. The steps below should also generally apply to any
other online forms service.

### Step 1: Create the form.

Using your online form provider of choice, create your form! A simple form would include a text box for inputting an email, with a simple check to see if
the entered email is valid.

_[INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE OF SUCH FORM]_

On Google Forms, you have an option to implement email checking with the following option.

_[INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE OF SUCH CHECKING]_

### Step 2: Obtain the embed snippet.

Obtain the HTML snippet which you can paste into your website.

Press send.

_[INSERT SCREENSHOT OF SEND BUTTON]_

Go to the embed tab.

_[INSERT SCREENSHOT OF EMBED TAB]_

Copy the snippet.

### Step 3: Embed the embed

Paste the snippet where ever you want to put the form on your site!

_[INSERT SCREENSHOT OF SNIPPET IN AN ACTUAL QMD FILE]_

You can adjust the size of the embed by tweaking these values.

_[INSERT SCREENSHOT OF VALUES HIGHLIGHTED]_

### Step 4: Unsubscribing.

Repeat steps 1-3 above and create a form that would allow subscribers to unsubscribe from receiving notifications. Make sure this form is clearly
accessible in your site.

### Step 5: Gathering emails.

Head to the responses tab of your form.

_[INSERT SCREENSHOT OF RESPONSES TAB]_

From here, you can take any emails received in put them into a mailing list in your email service of choice. **At the same time,** check the responses of
your unsubscribe form and tally them against the responses received in your subscribe form. Remove any emails that need to be removed.

### Step 6: Compose and send!

Now simple compose the email how you would like to and hit that send button!

:::{.callout-warning appearance="simple"}
# Before you hit that send button!
Make sure you include a clearly visible link in your email that would allow recipients to unsubscribe.

### Step 0: Extras

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple}
You could combine the subscribe and unsubscribe forms into a single form so it would be easier to manage. The form would initially ask if a user would like
to subscribe or unsubscribe. Based on their input, the form would take them to the appropriate section.

Further expanding on this, if your site has multiple feeds, the form could also ask which feed the user would like to subscribe or unsubscribe from.

## Option 3: HTML & JS

Perhaps you already know some HTML and JS, or even only JS, but still don't have an alternative address and want to get started. Instead of creating the front
end with HTML, try using the [Quarto HTML Forms](https://github.com/jlgraves-ubc/forms) extension by [Jonathan Graves](https://github.com/jlgraves-ubc).
With this extension, you are able to implement HTML forms with Quarto. However, you still need to handle the backend with JavaScript. If you're interested
in implementing it in this way, you probably already know how to. If you don't there are plenty of guides out there ðŸ˜‰.
